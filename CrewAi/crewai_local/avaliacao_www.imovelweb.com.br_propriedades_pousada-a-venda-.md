Investment Recommendation – Proceed with Caution, but Only After Addressing Critical Risks**

#### **1. Summary of Key Findings**  
- **Financial Viability (Post-CAPEX):**  
  - **Annual NOI:** R$954,000 (assuming 60% occupancy and R$300 ADR).  
  - **Cap Rate:** 19.08% (high but reflects risk premium for Paraty's niche market).  
  - **Payback Period:** ~4.5 years (long but feasible with disciplined operations).  
  - **NPV (Year 1):** Negative (R$-3.4M), but could turn positive with long-term growth.  

- **Legal Risks:**  
  - **Critical Missing Documents:** No property registration, zoning/tombamento status, or certificates (CND, IPTU, etc.).  
  - **Hidden Liabilities:** Potential legal disputes, tax debts, or environmental violations.  
  - **Recommendation:** **No-Go** until legal due diligence is completed with verified documentation.  

- **CAPEX Requirements:**  
  - **Total CAPEX:** R$4.266M (including 20% contingency).  
  - **Critical Repairs:** Electrical, waterproofing, and structural upgrades are urgent.

#### **2. Risk Assessment**  
- **High-Risk Factors:**  
  - **Legal Uncertainty:** Absence of key documents (matrícula, zoneamento, CND) exposes the buyer to **title disputes, zoning violations, or fines**.  
  - **Financial Exposure:** CAPEX is **85% of purchase price**, with no immediate revenue offset.  
  - **Market Volatility:** Paraty’s tourism is seasonal, and competition from boutique hotels may pressure ADR/occupancy.  

- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  - **Legal Due Diligence:** Insist on **presential inspection** and obtain **certificates of ownership, zoning, and environmental compliance** before signing.  
  - **Financing:** Secure **low-interest loans** or partnerships to cover CAPEX.  
  - **Revenue Diversification:** Leverage Paraty’s heritage (e.g., weddings, cultural tours) to boost income.  

---

#### **3. Investment Decision**  
- **Short-Term Outlook:** **Not Viable** due to:  
  - Negative NPV in Year 1.  
  - High legal/operational risks without verified documentation.  

- **Long-Term Potential:** **Conditional Yes** if:  
  - **All legal risks are mitigated** (e.g., clear title, zoning approval).  
  - **CAPEX is completed on time and within budget**.  
  - **Market penetration is achieved** through branding (e.g., "eco-friendly heritage hotel").  

---

#### **4. Final Recommendation**  
- **Do Not Proceed** with the purchase **until**:  
  1. **Legal documents** (matrícula, CND, zoneamento, IPTU) are verified.  
  2. **Environmental and zoning compliance** is confirmed.  
  3. **Feasibility study** confirms demand for a boutique hotel in Paraty.  

- **Alternative Actions:**  
  - **Negotiate a lower purchase price** (e.g., R$3.5M) to reduce CAPEX burden.  
  - **Phase CAPEX** over 2–3 years with interim revenue streams (e.g., short-term rentals).  

- **Conclusion:** The property has **long-term potential** but requires **rigorous due diligence, financing, and market differentiation** to succeed. Proceed only after **all legal and financial risks are resolved**.  

**Final Verdict: NO-GO until critical legal and financial uncertainties are resolved.**
